# Naive_bayes_FHE
A Naive-Bayes classifier that uses the Fan and Vercauteran Fully Homomorphic Encyrption Scheme to assure privacy of data

The classifier is written in the R language and makes uses of the Homomorphic Encryption package developed by Louis Aslett. For instructions on how to install the Fully Homomorphic encryption package see https://www.louisaslett.com/HomomorphicEncryption/.

To use the scripts, first of all prepare your dataset in CSV format.
